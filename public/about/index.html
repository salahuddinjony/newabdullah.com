He currently leads LLM initiatives at Aisera, where he architects agentic AI systems for IT and HR domains. His work includes fine-tuning cutting-edge LLaMA-3 models, enhancing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and optimizing model deployment to save millions in infrastructure costs. Previously, Abdullah was a Machine Learning Engineer at Meta, contributing to Ads Ranking and GenAI-based ad creation, generating hundreds of millions in incremental revenue. He played a pivotal role in fine-tuning and optimizing Meta’s LLaMA models for personalized ad experiences. Academically, he holds a PhD in Applied Machine Learning from Florida International University, where his research focused on interpretable deep learning for cancer diagnosis and drug recommendations. His journey spans research, academia, and production-level AI systems—with deep expertise in LLMs, Transformers, and scalable ML systems. Long Abdullah Al Mamun, PhD, has spent over a decade at the forefront of ML research and applied AI, with a mission to bridge academic excellence and industry-scale impact. His journey spans multiple countries, top-tier institutions, and FAANG, culminating in his current role shaping the future of agentic AI. He began his academic career in Bangladesh, earning a BS in CSE from Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology (DUET), where his early interest in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) took root. Pursuing deeper expertise, he moved to KSA, earning a Master’s in Computer Engineering from King Fahd University of Petroleum \u0026 Minerals (KFUPM). During this period, he developed an LSTM-based sentiment analysis system that achieved 98% accuracy on customer feedback data. In 2017, he joined Qatar University as a machine learning researcher and went on to win the 2nd GCC Robotics Challenge, a milestone that recognized his innovation in AI and robotics. Later that year, Abdullah moved to the United States to pursue a PhD in CS at Florida International University (FIU). His research focused on interpretable deep learning for early-stage cancer detection and drug recommendation. His work resulted in multiple publications and travel fellowships to premier conferences such as ACM BCB and IEEE BIBM, reflecting both academic rigor and translational impact. In 2022, Abdullah transitioned to industry, joining Meta (formerly Facebook) as a Research Scientist. At Meta, he worked on large-scale ads ranking, personalization, and generative ad creation using cutting-edge techniques like MTML and Transformer based sequence learning model. Also, he collaborated with Meta AI played a critical role in integrating LLMs into ad creation workflows, leading to a $xxxM boost in iRev by improving CTR and CVR. He also led development of AutoCA audience clustering, which optimized ad targeting, contributing another $xxxM in revenue growth. In 2024, Abdullah joined Aisera as a Senior Research Scientist, where he now leads the design and deployment of agentic AI systems for enterprise IT and HR automation. He architected a scalable, reusable onboarding agent, and spearheaded the migration from commercial APIs (e.g., GPT-4) to in-house fine-tuned LLaMA-3 models, saving the company CAPEX significantly. He also enhanced the RAG pipeline, improving real-time semantic search performance by 93%. Throughout his career, Abdullah has developed deep expertise in RecSys, LLMs, Transformers, RAG, vector databases, PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangChain, and inference optimization. He holds certifications from Google Cloud and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and continues to contribute actively to the field through open-source, research, and real-world deployment of AI systems. Now based in Fremont, California, he remains focused on building AI that is not only intelligent—but scalable, reliable, and transformative for enterprises and society alike. Outside of work, Abdullah leads an active lifestyle with a love for badminton, skiing, hiking, and mountain biking. He is also passionate about nature photography and has a deep appreciation for the outdoors. A frequent traveler, he has visited 16+ countries so far and continues to explore new cultures and landscapes to fuel his curiosity and creativity.
